# The "re" module contains funcitons related to regex

```{python}
# Import pandas for using regex on dataframes
import pandas as pd
```

```{python}
# You can use the re.search function to see if a pattern has a match
match_or_not = re.search("H[oq]", "Hola")
print(match_or_not)
```

```{python}
# If there is no match, the function will return None
not_matched = re.search("Jo", "Holla")

```

```{python}
# Defining a helper function to return matches against a series

# Sets are used to check if a character in an specific position is on a list of characters

```{python}
# Sets can also be written as ranges
# [0-9]
# [a-z] (lower case letters from a to z)
# [A-Z] (upper case letters)
# [0-9a-zA-Z] (the combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters and digits)

```{python}
# Shorthand notation for sets, also known as character classes are
# \d for digits
# \w for words
# \s fro space, tabs and linebreaks
# . for any character except newline

sets3 = pd.Series(["1 uno", "2 dos", "tres"])

# This regex match any word that has a number in the first position, a space on the second position and
# a character on the third and following positions

```{python}
# Quantifiers indicate the times a character or set can appear and are written in curved brackets
quantifiers = pd.Series(['aalas', 'alaas', 'alas'])

# This regex match any word that contains the letter a two times

```{python}
# Quantifiers also have a shorthand syntax

quantifiers2 = pd.Series(["a space", "a     space", "aspace"])

# a* to match the expression zero or more times
# a+ to indicate that the expression can appear one or more times
# a? to indicate that the expression can appear one or no times

# Word boundaries happens at the end and beginning of a string or between word characters
# They are dennoted with \b

# This regex would match anything that has a c at the end of the line
test_match(r'.+c\b', word_boundaries)
```

```{python}
# Anchors, specially at the beginning and at the end are usefull to match expression that 
# have a certain pattern in the beginning or in the end of the string
